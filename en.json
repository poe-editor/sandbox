The bigger your staking score, the more Raffle Tickets you will get.\n To get the maximum number of Raffle Tickets from the staking feature (500) you need to have accumulated at least 500 staking score points by the end of the Alpha Season 3.\n\n 2. {1} The bigger everyone’s staking score is, the more the Community Reward Booster increases. The more the Community Reward Booster increases, the more the Season 3 Alpha Pass SAND reward is increased for all.\n The Community Reward Booster is capped at a maximum of +100%.

If by the end of Alpha Season 3, the community staking score reached 40,000,000 points or more, the Community Reward Booster will reach +100%. Therefore, the S3AP reward will be increased by +100% and reach 500 SAND for all S3AP owners.\n - If by the end of Alpha Season 3, the community staking score reached 24,800,000 points, the Community Reward Booster will reach +62%.

For every 1 SAND staked for the whole duration of the Alpha (70 days) you get 1 staking score point.\n It means that if you stake 500 SAND for 70 days you will earn the max amount of Raffle Tickets.
