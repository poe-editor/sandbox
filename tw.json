If by the end of Alpha Season 3, the community staking score reached 40,000,000 points or more, the Community Reward Booster will reach +100%. Therefore, the S3AP reward will be increased by +100% and reach 500 SAND for all S3AP owners.\n - If by the end of Alpha Season 3, the community staking score reached 24,800,000 points, the Community Reward Booster will reach +62%.
